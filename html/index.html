	Online media outlets generate some portion of their revenue by displaying online advertisements. Since ad blockers have been in use for some time, most media outlets have gotten smart and installed code to detect users with ad blockers. If an ad blocker is present, it typically renders the site unreadable until the user whitelists the website.

      <p>
	I don't	know anyone who	intentionally goes to MSNBC for	their news, but	in keeping up with current events, sometimes one accidentally clicks on a less-credible news site. Having an ad blocker installed will prevent the site from getting a couple pennies on each accidental click.

	When you open a webpage, it usually loads dozens of other files in the background. Some of these extra files are "good" (images, videos, JavaScript) and some are not (Ads, JavaScript). An Ad Blocker analyzes these requests before they're sent and blocks URLs that are known or believed to be related to serving advertising content.
      </p>

      <p>
	Installing an ad blocker is safe and easy. Generally, you just have to click the "Install" button, and it'll start blocking ads by default. For security reasons, you should stick to one of the trusted/well-known ones. An incomplete list is below.

      <p>
	NB: Some search engines take into consideration the length of stay on a page. The theory is that if a user clicks the "Back" button quickly, that link was probably not what they were looking for, and the page gets a mark against it in the algorithm, so to speak.
